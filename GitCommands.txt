*Create a new repository on the command line

git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M master
git remote add origin https://github.com/springprojectpoc/poc.git (to remove use command : git remote remove origin)
git push -u origin master

*Unstage committed file
	git rm --cached ReadMe.md.txt    
	
*Create branch from local : 
	git branch new_branch_name
	
It creates branch locally. The current branch master-2 has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use command
    git push --set-upstream origin master-2
Now branch reflects in branch dropdown

	
*git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory
